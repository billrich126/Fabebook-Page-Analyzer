I've moved to many places, that's not home. So no, I don't live with my parents. I haven't done you guys a damn thing, why u gotta comment that muchh bullshit? I have feelings too, like everybody else on this planet. Since 1st grade people have been on me. Even the teatchers. When I was 10, I started smoking pot, and other stuff. Also used to drink alot, end up in fights, but I came out of it. And now i'm tryng to be myself, and I still got hate. One of my family members died for not long ago too, so i'm really upset. I joined this group to make new friends, and this is what I get. Again, I haven't done u guys anything wrong, so why won't u just show some fuckings respect?",
