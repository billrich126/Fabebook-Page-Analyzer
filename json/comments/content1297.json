First, one guy shows everyone a picture, then everybody else begins laughing and parroting phrases back and forth. Everybody in a room, just repeating shit over and over, \"Me too thanks!\" \"Me too thanks!\" Then someone takes the picture, and draws something else on top of it; usually something we can all recognize from before. And everybody laughs and parrots the same phrase again, \"O shit waddup\" \"90kg projectile!\" \"Me too thanks!\" If you imagine it, it looks like we're all in an insane asylum. In fact, that's really all we do here; just drive each other insane. We keep repeating the same shit over and over until one person finally snaps, and everybody agrees and moves onto something else. Then the whole fucking cycle repeats itself. We're all stuck in the Loony Bin and nobody can escape because we just keep feeding into each other's crippling mental illness. And I don't know if I can fucking take it anymore, one of these days I'm just going to lose every last bit of san- Lol I mean me too thanks.\n\n\nPerson 2: Haha I wonder if someone will post this on Overheard \n\n-Overheard in Daddy DeNero's Webcast",
