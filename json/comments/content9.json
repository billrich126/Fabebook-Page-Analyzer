Most Berkeley students would have protested but still allowed the Milo speech to occur. It was an outside organization that saw to it that it didn't. While most of what took place that night was needless and terrible, it is in no way an indicator that free speech is dead. It just shows that on both sides of the political spectrum there are people who are willing to resort to violence and destruction to silence their opposition.",
