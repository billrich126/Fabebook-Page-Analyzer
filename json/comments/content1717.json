Memers at UC Berkeley make it their goal to give memers a place to feel comfortable as well as better the meme community. Comparing specific memers to students from different schools is absurd and beyond inaccurate. Making the claim that memers are low-quality is demeaning the memehood and the lack of values it is founded on.

No one's arguing that.\nAs someone who is a scientist who studies puppers, doggos, yappers, and even woofers, I am telling you, specifically, in doggology, no one calls puppers doggos. If you want to be \"specific\" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.\nIf you're saying \"doggo family\" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Doggodaemous, which includes things from sub woofers to birdos to sharkos (the glub glub kind not the bork bork kind).\nSo your reasoning for calling a pupper a doggo is because random people \"call the small yip yip ones doggos?\" Let's get penguos and turkos in there, then, too.\nAlso, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A pupper is a pupper and a member of the doggo family. But that's not what you said. You said a pupper is a doggo, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the doggo family doggos, which means you'd call piggos, sluggos, and other species doggos, too. Which you said you don't.\nIt's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?",
