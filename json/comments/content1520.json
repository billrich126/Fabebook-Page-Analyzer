            "message": "Well, you do make a good point. However, perspective is also important. There's not much grade inflation at Cal; in fact there's a lot of grade deflation. Many students will get C+'s in classes in which they are just slightly below the average. While consistently worrying about bad grades is not healthy, it's not that people at Cal have no self-confidence or grade self esteem (at least I think). Many of these people are actually going to get B's and C's despite working as hard as they can because the competition is so tough. This is especially true for many technical classes; you can grasp the concepts well but still struggle on the tests because the tests are meant to be tricky and will test your ability to apply your skills to problems you have never seen before. In this type of environment, I think it's natural for people to want to vent their disappointment, so making the situation comical is a good way to do that. Also, most Cal students got straight A's or close to straight A's in high school, so when they get B's and C's in their freshman year at Cal they are understandably disappointed and will feel like their semester is a failure, worth shit, etc etc.",
