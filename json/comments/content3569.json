YES on Measure U1 to reinvest in our memes, and reinvest in our communities and our children. \nSeriously though this is disappointing. I do NOT want to see this page overrun with Buzzfeed-ass \"memes\" which are just images with white block text over them. Memes are expressions of nonsense and anger and desperation and everything \"not okay\". We are part meme because we understand that while it isn't in the literal sense real, it's artistically or metaphorically real. \nFrankly, I think that the quality of memes hasn't been that high in this group anyways, but THIS shit, this corporate-what-do-kids-like bullshit... is the absolute bottom. \nAlex I don't think you're worthless I just think these images are worthless",
