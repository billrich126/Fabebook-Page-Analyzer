Sororities at UC Berkeley make it their goal to give women a place to feel comfortable as well as better the community. Comparing specific houses to characters from a movie about bullying is absurd and beyond inaccurate. Making the claim that sororities are cliques is demeaning the sisterhood and values they are founded on. This clearly is a stab at a community on campus that does nothing but support the rest of the student body.",

I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on Greek Row, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of sisters across the USA and your bids are being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your social life. You\u2019re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that\u2019s just with my makeup bag. Not only am I extensively trained in drinking games, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Panhellenic council and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the party scene, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little \u201cclever\u201d comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn\u2019t, you didn\u2019t, and now you\u2019re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You\u2019re fucking dead, kiddo.",
