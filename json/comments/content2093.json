Why is the comparison offensive to you? I wish I had the problems the people in mean girls did like who is taking me to prom or making sure I wear pink on Wednesday. because other people have problems like fear of deportation, police brutality, being starving and broke cause their parents can't pay for them to be in a co-op like yours did. I know this message does not apply to everyone in the co-op system BUT OMG ITS A MEME PAGE TAKE A JOKE BITCHES",
