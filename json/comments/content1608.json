We don't want to eliminate user input but 40,000 people from lesser meme schools joining the group and diluting content quality down to stanford/ucla meme levels isn't democratic user input - a democratic society requires its population to be educated about its values and ideologies to have productive dialogues.

This is both because of recent changes in modstyle resulting in a pretty light/lax mod presence as well as an influx of users who don't really understand what UCBMFET is about and treat it as just another repost depository. We don't want to eliminate user input but 40,000 people from lesser meme schools joining the group and diluting content quality down to stanford/ucla meme levels isn't democratic user input - a democratic society requires its population to be educated about its values and ideologies to have productive dialogues. Joining this group with no knowledge of its history and then arguing that it should be more like stanford or ucla memes isn't constructive. UCBMFET is very intentionally trying to distance itself from those cultures.",
