As for the large amount harassment towards them, i already have reported it to Facebook. Maybe y'all should learn to respect others, if you don't want this group to get banned. Even if you guys disagree, i think it is better to give girls the benefit of the doubt. My beautiful girlfriend agrees with me. Eat shit UCBMFET. Righteousness prevails once again if you read the first letters of each sentence.",

Sororities at UC Berkeley make it their goal to give women a place to feel comfortable as well as better the community. Comparing specific houses to characters from a movie about bullying is absurd and beyond inaccurate. Making the claim that sororities are cliques is demeaning the sisterhood and values they are founded on. This clearly is a stab at a community on campus that does nothing but support the rest of the student body.",
